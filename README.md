# i3lock-next

This branch of i3lock-next was an experiment using ImageMagick whose goal was
to allow greater flexibility and more effects to be integrated. Unfortunately
even the C API for ImageMagick is very slow and thus the project will not adopt
ImageMagick as the primary image manipulation library.
