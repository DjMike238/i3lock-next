# i3lock-next

i3lock-next is a bash script and a C helper program much like [i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy). i3lock-next aims to be much faster by using a C implementation of [Imlib2](https://docs.enlightenment.org/api/imlib2/html/index.html) rather than ImageMagick.

## Dependencies

- Imlib2
- bash
- fontconfig
